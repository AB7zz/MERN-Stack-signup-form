# How to start this form

1. Open your terminal
2. Enter "cd client" and "npm start"
3. Move out of the client folder and start ther server folder
4. To do this, enter "cd ../" and then "cd server" and finally "nodemon index.js"
5. Now go to the .env file inside the folder *server* and replace my username and password with your database username and password
6. And hopefully that should work!
