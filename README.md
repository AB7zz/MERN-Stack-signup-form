# How to start this form

1. Open your terminal
2. Enter "cd client" and "npm start"
3. Move out of the client folder and start ther server folder
4. To do this, enter "cd ../" and then "cd server" and finally "nodemon index.js"
5. Now go to the .env file inside the folder *server* and replace my username and password with your database username and password
6. And hopefully that should work!


# Drawbacks

Sincee this was intended to be a very simple sign up form, it doesn't encrypt your password before inserting into Db.

# Happy Coding!
